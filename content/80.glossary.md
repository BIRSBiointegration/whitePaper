| network | graph, adjacency matrix | A set of *nodes*, representing objects of interest, linked by *edges*, representing specific relationships between nodes. | ? |
| node | vertex | Element of interest in a network and linked to other nodes. For example: people, cells, proteins or genes. Nodes can have several properties called *attributes* like cell type or position. | ? |
| edge | link | The relationship between 2 nodes in a network. For example: friendship in social networks, cells in contact in a spatial network, or gene-gene interactions in a gene regulatory network. | ? |
| concordant | concordant, coherent, consistent | ? | @doi:10/gghpmf |
| contributions | variable weights, loadings, eigenvector, axis, direction, dimension, coefficients, slopes | Contributions of the original variables in constructing the components. | @doi:10/gcj84s, @doi:10/f52wrr |
| latent factors | variates, scores, projections, components, latent/hidden/unobserved variables/factors | Weighted linear combinations of the original variables. | @doi:10/gcj84s, @doi:10/f52wrr |
| multimodal | Multiview, multiway arrays, multimodal, multidomain, multiblock, multitable, multi-omics, multi-source data analysis methods, N-integration | Methods pertaining to the analysis of multiple data matrices for the same set of observations. | @doi:10/gcj84s, @doi:10/gf8dqn, @doi:10/f83qvd |

| variable | feature, variable | A measurable quantity that describes an observation's attributes. Variables from different modalities include age, sex, gene or protein abundance, single nucleotide variants, operational taxonomic units, pixel intensity *etc.* | ? |
| biomarker | marker, biomarker | A variable that is associated with normal or disease processes, or responses to exposures, or interventions. Any change in this variable is also associated with a change in the associated clinical outcome. These variables may be used for diagnostic, monitoring, Pharmacodynamic responses. Examples include LDL cholesterol, CD4 counts, hemoglobin A1C. | @doi:10/gcxh8n |
| panel | biomarker panel, biomarker signature | A subset of the originally measured variables that are determined to be associated with the outcome or response variable. This may be determined using statistical inference, feature selection methods, or machine/statistical learning.  | @doi:10/d2cm, @doi:10/d2cn |
| observation | sample, observation, array | A single entity belonging to a larger grouping. Examples include patients, subjects, participants, cells, biological sample, usually the unit of observation on which the variables are measured *etc.* | ? |
